# Technical Evidence Pack
### Denhe reRuzivo AI — Intelligent Quality Management Copilot

This repository is the concept-stage technical evidence pack for QMIZ's AI for Impact Challenge submission. The product is not yet a deployed application; the documents describe the proposed system, controls and pilot validation plan.

## Why AI is necessary

Quality-management implementation requires repeatedly connecting an organisation's context, evidence and documents with multiple technical standards, regulatory guidance and approved templates. This work is expensive and time-consuming when performed manually, and the required expertise is not evenly accessible across Zimbabwe. RAG can retrieve authorised, relevant knowledge; an LLM can turn that context into structured drafts, explanations, checklists and analysis; and multilingual workflows can improve employee understanding.

AI is an assistance layer, not an authority. It does not replace official standards, competent consultants, auditors, certification bodies, laboratory assessors or regulatory decisions.

## Output-validation approach

1. Restrict retrieval to authorised, versioned and rights-controlled sources.
2. Display source references and flag missing or insufficient evidence.
3. Validate output structure, required fields and prohibited claims before presenting a draft.
4. Test representative document, audit, risk, RCA and translation workflows against expert-reviewed cases during the pilot.
5. Require qualified human review and controlled approval before any output is published, implemented or relied upon.

## Post-challenge plan

### First 30 days

* Select a QMIZ pilot partner and establish governance, privacy, consent and data-rights agreements.
* Confirm priority use cases, the applicable standards and authorised source material.
* Define baseline measures: document-development time, audit quality, source coverage, review acceptance and local-language usability.
* Build and test the controlled retrieval pipeline with expert-reviewed sample cases.

### Days 31–90

* Onboard 15–20 pilot users and provide responsible-use and approval-workflow training.
* Run controlled evaluations of document drafting, audit support, risk registers, RCA and Shona/Ndebele explanation or translation.
* Track quality, safety, privacy and usability issues; correct validated defects and retire unsuitable content.
* Produce a pilot evaluation report and go/no-go recommendation for a wider QMIZ-led deployment.
